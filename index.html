        <p> From all the places I’ve visited, New York is by far the best one. From the multitude of cultures to 
            the towering buildings, I often felt like I belonged there. The streets are always alive, with music, 
            food, and people from every corner of the world. I loved walking through Central Park in the morning 
            and watching the city light up at night. Every neighborhood tells a different story, and every moment 
            feels like a movie scene. It’s a place where you can lose yourself and find yourself at the same time. 
            New York isn’t just a city it’s an experience.</p>

        <h2>ICONIC PLACES</h2>
        <hr>
        <p>
            New York is home to some of the world’s most iconic places. From the bright lights of Times Square to the 
            peaceful paths of Central Park, every spot tells a story. The Statue of Liberty stands tall as a symbol 
            of freedom, while the Empire State Building offers breathtaking views of the city. It’s a place where 
            history and modern life blend perfectly. 
            <br>
            Walking across the Brooklyn Bridge at sunset feels like stepping into a painting. The museums, like The
            Met and MoMA, hold treasures from around the globe. Grand Central Terminal isn’t just a station;  it’s a 
            masterpiece of architecture. You can grab a slice of New York-style pizza on nearly every block. 
            Broadway’s theaters light up the night with unforgettable shows. Everywhere you turn, New York leaves you
            with something to remember.

        <h2> TIMES SQUARE</h2>
        <img src="timesquare.jpg" alt="Time Square">
     
        <h2>Why Times Square?</h2>
        <p>Times Square, often called "The Crossroads of the World," is a bustling commercial intersection and 
            entertainment hub in Midtown Manhattan, New York City. Renowned for its dazzling array of billboards and
            neon signs, it's a spectacle of light and a major global tourist destination, attracting millions annually.
            Originally known as Longacre Square, it was renamed in 1904 after The New York Times moved its 
            headquarters there.</p>
        <p>The area is the heart of the Broadway Theater District, offering world-class theatrical productions. Times
            Square is also famous for its iconic New Year's Eve ball drop, a tradition dating back to 1907 that draws
            massive crowds and is broadcast worldwide. Beyond its bright lights and performances, visitors can explore
            attractions like Madame Tussauds, various shops, and a vibrant street atmosphere with performers. 
            Its energetic, non-stop character truly embodies the spirit of New York City.</p>

        <h2>CENTRAL PARK</h2>
        <img src="centralpark.jpg" alt="Central Park">
        <p>Central Park, an 843-acre masterpiece of landscape architecture, serves as Manhattan's verdant heart, 
            offering a vital escape from the urban grind. Conceived in the mid-19th century, it was designed by 
            Frederick Law Olmsted and Calvert Vaux, transforming a rocky, swampy landscape into the picturesque 
            haven it is today, though its creation controversially displaced communities like Seneca Village.</p>

        <p>This entirely man-made park features a diverse array of attractions, including the tranquil Bethesda Terrace
            and Fountain, the enchanting Conservatory Garden, and the historical Belvedere Castle. Visitors can enjoy 
            activities like boating on the Lake, ice skating at Wollman Rink, exploring the various woodlands and 
            meadows, or paying tribute at Strawberry Fields, the John Lennon memorial. With 58 miles of pedestrian 
            routes, it's a popular spot for runners, cyclists, and leisurely strolls, and a significant habitat for 
            over 200 bird species. Central Park remains one of the most visited urban parks globally, a testament to 
            its enduring design and role as a cultural and recreational hub.</p>

        <h2>STATUE OF LIBERTY</h2>
        <img src="statutofliberty.jpg" alt="Statue of Liberty">
        <p> The Statue of Liberty, officially "Liberty Enlightening the World," stands majestically on Liberty Island 
            in New York Harbor, a universal symbol of freedom and democracy. A gift from the people of France to the 
            United States, it was dedicated on October 28, 1886. Designed by French sculptor Frédéric Auguste Bartholdi
            , with an internal iron framework by Gustave Eiffel, the colossal copper statue portrays Libertas, the 
            Roman goddess of liberty, holding a torch high and a tablet inscribed with the date of American 
            Independence.</p>

        <p>Initially intended to commemorate the centennial of American independence and the friendship between 
            France and the U.S., it also celebrated the abolition of slavery. Over time, particularly with the influx 
            of immigrants through nearby Ellis Island, it became a powerful beacon of hope and opportunity, famously
            embodied by Emma Lazarus's poem "The New Colossus." Its iconic presence and enduring message make it one
            of the most recognizable landmarks globally.</p>
        <h3>Five Reason to Visit The Statue of Liberty</h3>
        <ol>
        <li> <strong>A Universal Symbol of Freedom and Democracy:</strong> The Statue of Liberty is arguably the 
            most recognizable symbol of freedom and democracy worldwide. Seeing it in person allows you to connect 
            with this powerful ideal and understand its significance for millions of people, historically and in the 
            present day.</li>
            
        <li><strong>Historical and Cultural Significance:</strong> It's a testament to the enduring friendship between 
            France and the United States, gifted to commemorate American independence and the abolition of slavery. 
            Visiting offers a tangible connection to this shared history and its evolution as a symbol of hope and 
            opportunity for immigrants arriving in America.</li>
            
        <li><strong>An Engineering and Artistic Masterpiece:</strong> Designed by Frédéric Auguste Bartholdi with an internal 
            framework by Gustave Eiffel (of Eiffel Tower fame), the statue is an impressive feat of 19th-century 
            engineering and art. Witnessing its colossal scale and intricate construction up close is truly 
            awe-inspiring.</li>
            
        <li> <strong>Proximity to Ellis Island:</strong> Your visit to Liberty Island often includes a ferry ride 
            that also stops at Ellis Island, the historic gateway for millions of immigrants. This combined experience 
            offers a profound understanding of the immigrant journey and the role the Statue of Liberty played in 
            their arrival.</li>
            
        <li> <strong>Iconic Views of New York Harbor and the Skyline:</strong> From Liberty Island, you'll be treated 
            to breathtaking panoramic views of the Manhattan skyline, including prominent landmarks like the Brooklyn 
            Bridge and One World Trade Center, as well as the bustling New York Harbor.</li>
